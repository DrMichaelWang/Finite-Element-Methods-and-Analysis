          THE TABLE ABOVE PROVIDES A STEP BY STEP SUMMARY OF SOME BASIC SIZING INFORMATION
          FOR THE PROBLEM. SOME FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE PARAMETERS GIVEN FOLLOWS:
  
          (1) MAXIMUM DOF WAVEFRONT - SIZE OF THE BIGGEST FRONT IN THE EQUATION SOLVER.
              PROVIDES A BASIC SIZING OF THE MOST MEMORY INTENSIVE SEGMENT OF SOLVER.
          (2) FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS PER ITERATION - MEASURE OF THE NUMBER OF FLOATING
              POINT OPERATIONS REQUIRED FOR A SINGLE SOLVER PASS. ON A GIVEN PLATFORM
              THE TIME REQUIRED FOR A SOLVER PASS WILL BE ROUGHLY A LINEAR FUNCTION
              OF THIS VALUE.
              NOTE - EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST STEP, THE VALUE IN THIS TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE
                     ADDITIONAL FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN MULTIPLE LOAD
                     CASE STEPS WHEN CONSTRAINTS CHANGE FROM LOAD CASE TO LOAD CASE.  THIS
                     SITUATION CAUSES A REORDERING TO BE PERFORMED, AT WHICH TIME AN UPPER
                     BOUND ON THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS WILL BE
                     CALCULATED AND INCLUDED UNDER THE ESTIMATE SUMMARIES FOR THE RELEVANT
                     STEPS (SEE NOTE BELOW ON REORDERING).
          (3) MINIMUM MEMORY REQUIRED - MINIMUM POSSIBLE MEMORY VALUE FOR standard_memory
              THAT ENABLES ABAQUS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. USE OF MEMORY WILL BE MINIMIZED BY
              WRITING AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO DISK WHICH WILL INCREASE I/O TIME.
          (4) MEMORY TO MINIMIZE I/O - VALUE OF standard_memory THAT ALLOWS ABAQUS TO KEEP
              ALL SIGNIFICANT SCRATCH FILES IN MEMORY. THIS WILL MINIMIZE I/O TIME FOR THE USER
              WITH ACCESS TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF MEMORY.
          (5) REQUIRED DISKSPACE - AMOUNT OF DISK REQUIRED FOR SCRATCH FILES. THESE WILL BE
              DELETED AT THE END OF THE ANALYSIS.
  
  
           NOTE - WHENEVER POSSIBLE THE USER SHOULD SET standard_memory TO BE LESS THAN THE
          PHYSICAL MEMORY ON THE MACHINE. UNLESS NECESSARY USERS SHOULD NOT MAKE USE
          OF VIRTUAL MEMORY EVEN IN AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP SCRATCH FILES IN MEMORY.
  
           NOTE - IF A REORDERING IS PERFORMED (THIS WILL GENERALLY BE DONE ONLY FOR 3D-3D
          LARGE SLIDING PROBLEMS), THE SIZE ESTIMATES DONE AT THIS TIME WILL NO LONGER BE VALID.
          THE ESTIMATES WILL BE REDONE IN THE EVENT OF A REORDERING AND A NEW SUMMARY WILL BE
          BE PRINTED FOR THE REMAINING STEPS.
